    <section class="career_goals">
      <p>My goal is to become an elite software engineer by taking the skills I already have and applying them to the company. This will be beneficial to both me and the company as I will be doing quality work as well as always improving my skills. My hope is that I will never be satisfied with what I know and will always be picking up more skills and new information.</p>
